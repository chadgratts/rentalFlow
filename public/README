Hello, welcome! This is an apartment rental manager app that keeps
track of available unit inside apartment buildings. I aimed to keep it functional,
fairly intuitive to use and not overly complex. Therefore I kept the username and
password in the session, and designed the application to be a single user application. 
Thank you for your feedback.
